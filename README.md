# Solar-Salesman
Completly designed in C++ and very excited to share this program!  
This program allows the user to be in the position of a sales person and choose a travel route that best suites their needs
## Program Description
The program focuses on specific cities within whats known as the **Inland Empire**.  
  
It should be noted that the preffered start point is **Riverside**.
  
As the user selects what options best suites their root, a menu choice will become available. 
  
With each menu display, their are reminders of city parameters just in case there's someone new on the job.  
  
Options to choose from include: **Field Matrix, Shortest Route, and City Adjacencies**.    
  
Please view source code for algorithmic breakdown.
